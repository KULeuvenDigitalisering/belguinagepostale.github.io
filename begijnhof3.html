    <h1>The Flemish Béguinages</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="Leuven_beg2.JPG" style="width:420px;height:250px;">
        The Béguinages formed miniature towns, enclosed by walls or surrounded by ditches, with gates opening
        to the 'world' during the day. They were organized according to one of two models: one, the city type,
        reflecting on a smaller scale the model of a medieval city, with a plot set aside for the cemetery,
        or the square where the church is built; the other, the courtyard type, with a central area,
        varying in shape and often consisting of a lawn planted with trees, where the church is located,
        and around which the houses are aligned. A third or mixed type, the result of certain extensions
        in the 17th and 18th centuries, combines both layouts.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nowadays, they have been either partially dismantled like Antwerp, Hasselt, Petit Béguinage of Leuven,
        Petit Béguinage of Mechelen, Herentals, Aarschoot or largely incorporated into the urban fabric
        of the vicinity (Grand Béguinage of Gent) or suffered damage during either
        <br> the First or the Second World War.
